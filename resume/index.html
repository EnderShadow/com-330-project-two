          <p>
            I graduated with a BS in computer science from Illinois Institute of Technology. The coursework includes but is not
            limited to: data structures, systems programming, algorithms, parsers, operating systems, virtual machines, natural
            language processing, and information security.

            <h4>Love In Space – Sunrider</h4>
            <p>
              I worked as the assistant programmer for both "Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius" and "Sunrider: Liberation Day". I
              wrote, modularized, and optimized python code used by the game in order to make development easier and more
              efficient.

            <h4>X-Tek LLC – Software</h4>
            <p>
              I was the programmer for in-house software as well as software that was commisioned for other companies. The in-house
              Software mainly consisted of a script that was used to semi-automate virus removals as well as download the
              required programs that were used for the non-automated parts. One program that was commisioned used CSV files and
              a barcode scanner to ensure that items were placed in their proper location. It was written in Java and used
              Java FX for the UI.
