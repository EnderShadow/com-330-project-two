              I worked on optimizing functions related to the battle system in the game as well as modularizing various
              components to make it easier to add content to the game.

              My work on this game, which is the sequel to "Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius", consisted of similar work to the
              prequel. I did not have as active of a role in the development of this game as its predecessor.

              A media player that I wrote in Java which was originally intended to be a fully functional media player with
