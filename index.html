          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            My name is Matthew Warren. I'm currently a computer science student at Illinois Institute of Technology and am
            graduating in May of 2020. I've always been into computers since I was young. At first I just liked playing
            games on them, but as I got older I learned about how computers were put together from the times that my dad
            would perform maintenance on his work computer. I also learned about how they were put together from a local
            computer repair shop where I would occsionally hang out and help out at. Aside from how they were put together,
            became interested in how games were made and I wanted to go into game development. The one thing I remember
            about when I wanted to go into game development was how in the game "Star Wars Battlefront 2" (the 2005 version)
            there were locked doors in the spaceships during the space battles and I always thought it would be cool to be
            able to explore what was past them.

            During middle school I started learning programming. At first I was following C++ tutorials, but I quickly lost
            interest in that for one reason or another. About a year later I got back into programming, although this time
            I was using Java since I was learning to make mods for Minecraft. This is where I finally got into programming
            and started learning a lot. It wasn't until highschool when I really started learning about all the different
            things in programming though. From all the learning I did on my own time I, at the very least, learned a little
            bit about a lot of different topics related to computers. Some of the things I touched on were cpu design,
            assembly, compilers, games, security, and virtual machines.

            I worked on optimizing functions related to the battle system in the game as well as modularizing various
            components to make it easier to add content to the game.

            My work on this game, which is the sequel to "Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius", consisted of similar work to the
            prequel. I did not have as active of a role in the development of this game as its predecessor.

            A media player that I wrote in Java which was originally intended to be a fully functional media player with
            support for nested playlists. It is currently on hiatus.
