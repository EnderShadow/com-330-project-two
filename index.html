          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Matthew Warren. I have a strong interest in AI and how it can benefit humanity once strong AI is
            developed. I also like playing video games and programming in my free time. I'm from Fox River Grove, Illinois
            but I plan on living in San Francisco or somewhere with a similar year-round temperature.

            I have always been interested in programming since a young age. I remember there was a game where certain
            doors wouldn't open and I thought it would be cool to know how to program so that I'd be able to make those
            doors work so that I could see what was past them. I now know that it would be a much harder task than I
            thought to make the doors work as well as the fact that there wasn't anything beyond the doors anyway. After I
            learned the basics of programming and was able to write basic programs, I grew curious about how all sorts of
            things worked such as games, compilers, and computer hardware. I am now familiar with a wide variety of
            computer related topics and am very interested in AI and machine learning. Programming is something that I
            enjoy doing and plan to a make a living from.
