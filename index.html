        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Matthew Warren. I'm currently a computer science student at Illinois Institute of Technology and am
          graduating in May of 2020. I've always been into computers since I was young. At first I just liked playing
          games on them, but as I got older I learned about how computers were put together from the times that my dad
          would perform maintenance on his work computer. I also learned about how they were put together from a local
          computer repair shop where I would occsionally hang out and help out at. Aside from how they were put together,
          became interested in how games were made and I wanted to go into game development. The one thing I remember
          about when I wanted to go into game development was how in the game "Star Wars Battlefront 2" (the 2005 version)
          there were locked doors in the spaceships during the space battles and I always thought it would be cool to be
          able to explore what was past them.

          During middle school I started learning programming. At first I was following C++ tutorials, but I quickly lost
          interest in that for one reason or another. About a year later I got back into programming, although this time
          I was using Java since I was learning to make mods for Minecraft. This is where I finally got into programming
          and started learning a lot. It wasn't until highschool when I really started learning about all the different
          things in programming though. From all the learning I did on my own time I, at the very least, learned a little
          bit about a lot of different topics related to computers. Some of the things I touched on were cpu design,
          assembly, compilers, games, security, and virtual machines.
